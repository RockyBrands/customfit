                    </h5>
                    <p>Lehigh CustomFit is a always a step ahead when it comes to making sure you get the best fitting work boot - because we know just how valuable it is to your full body health and work performance.

                    <p>
                      If you have attended one of our on-site Ordering and Wellness Events at your facility location, then you may have had your feet scanned by our 3D Foot Scanner named Albert. If so, you can access your personal foot data and highly ranked style recommendations when you log into your dedicated CustomFit ordering website under MY PROFILE. These accurate recommendations come from comparing your data to 10s of millions of other 3D foot scans with mountains of manufacturing design data and even bigger mountains of consumer feedback data about how boots fit. Utilizing this technology makes recommending the best fitting boot to buy or order as accurate as it has ever been - even more than trying them on in the store and walking around for 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In case you have not had your feet scanned, we also offer True Fit on all of our websites. After a couple questions, True Fit will recommend a best fitting shoe based on a brand that you already have in your closet and you absolutely love because it fits so well.
